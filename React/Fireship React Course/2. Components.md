## Components
React components are reusable pieces of UI that developers compose together as a tree to represent  a complete fronte end application.

#### Defining componets with JSX
- JSX allows you to define dynamic values within HTML elements
- Functional components are most commonly used
- Return value of function is the component that we want to render

#### Sharing data with props
- We can pass data to child components through props
	- Data flow through prop drilling is stricly only from parent to child
	- This gives prop drilling a oneway data flow
	- When a prop changes, react re-renders all components that use it 
- React has a virtual DOM that reconciles the Real DOM

```javascript
function MyComponent(props) {
	return <p> Hello {props.name}! </p>
}

<MyComponent name="Marvin"/>
```
