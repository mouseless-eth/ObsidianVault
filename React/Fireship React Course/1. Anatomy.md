## React Anatomy
Most common way to start a create project is with **create-react-app**
```shell
npx create-react-app <app-name-here>
```

This tool manages webpack behind the scenes which bundles all javascript, css, html code into a seperate single files so that they can be used by a browser.

-   `package.json` - The main file that defines the dependencies and other settings for your project.
-   `node_modules` - Source code for depencies. Do not touch.
-   `public` - The directory where your static files are stored.
-   `src/index.js` - Main entrypoint to bootstrap the app.
-   `src/App.js` - The root component of the app.
-   `src/App.spec.js` - Unit tests for the app.
-   `src/*.css` - Styles for the app.
